18:18 - Made a start with documentation and the application, initially wanted to go with react but ironically the create app script actually comes with vulnerabilities so will be going with nextjs instead due to out the box setup that should be vulnerability free.

18:20 - can confirm vulnerability free.

18:25 - rough design for mobile main items being a header, a search bar with burger menu for filtering and cards in a two by two, depending on data this might have to change to be long thin items like a list item
