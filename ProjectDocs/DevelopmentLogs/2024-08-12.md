18:11 early start today, hopefully get this finished off. Going to start with the bean of the day

19:59 - having major problems just loading the all, frontend returns an empty array, sending a get request to the api works fine.

20:00 - As i wrote the above, deleted .next build folder, working now, must have been some strange caching? that was bizzare

20:35 - good progress now i figured that out, got the BOTD logic wrote and a component designed for it.

21:13 - had to refactor how some data was called for the main list page, mainly turning the component to be client rendered.

21:19 - it's strange working solo, i've missed merging a branch in, Merged now and created a search branch to deal with that feature, Kinda funny how that works with no one consuming your work.

22:29 - had some strange issues with caching and nextjs's documentation sometimes being contradictory. Calling it a night here, got a case insensitive way of searching the names.
