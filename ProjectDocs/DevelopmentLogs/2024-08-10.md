20:17 - finally got some time to get back to this, first port of call is make the Bean model match casing for c# (camel casing).

20:41 - bit of a pain getting the casing right but feel like it's important, going to get the frontend to populate the data using the back end now

20:54 - Merged the solution 2 branch down

21:04 - had some strange git behaviour from the obsidian config files, should have sorted it out earlier. Removed them from source control

21:21 - got master merged into the card branch, lets finally get the api called

21:38 - to allow  https communication to the backend (solution-2) added experimental flag for next to generate a self signed certificate

21:41 - misunderstood the problem, it's complaining it can't trust solution 2 because it's using a self signed cert, need to find a way for nextjs to trust that certificate

22:40 - got some basic cards mapping for the mobile view, calling it a night, I'll get the search working tomorrow then look at making all the resolutions working

22:45 had to add an exclusion to allow the frontend to consume a self signed certificate
