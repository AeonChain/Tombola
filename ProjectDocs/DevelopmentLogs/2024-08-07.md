20:51 - late, might get an hour or two in. Got the JSON object, would like to start solution-2 so I can just read from the api.

21:12 - investigated the json, seems sensible from a rough scan of the data it seems consistent but i'll find out once i parse it, looks like sqlite has support to read files so creating the schema should be relatively simple i think, created a migrations folder to store scripts for db creation
