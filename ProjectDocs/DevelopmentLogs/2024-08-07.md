20:51 - late, might get an hour or two in. Got the JSON object, would like to start solution-2 so I can just read from the api.

21:12 - investigated the json, seems sensible from a rough scan of the data it seems consistent but i'll find out once i parse it, looks like sqlite has support to read files so creating the schema should be relatively simple i think, created a migrations folder to store scripts for db creation

21:52 - installed sqlite, looking into how entity framework integrates with sqlite.

21:56 - had to battle with git ignore to ignore the bin files, .obsidian is still not being ignored strangely

22:09 - json has incosistent casing for column names, going to correct it during the db creation script it'll drive me nuts otherwise

22:13 - index is a column name has special properties in sqlite, going to omit this for now and setup an index in sqlite

22:27 - got the json loaded into sqlite, not sure if i should source control the db for the sake of ease or leave instructions to generate it.

22:31 - not sure about that index column, might just name it beanIndex to avoid any issues for now, amending script
