Technology choices:

Tailwind -
modern css framework that has out the box support for responsive design. I also prefer utility frameworks where composition is a core principle.

React - 
component driven frontend that is fammilar and has wide support.
noticed that the default version when installing react is react 18.3.1, opted for release candidate react@19.0.0-rc-fb9a90fa48-20240614
the release candidate seems to have other issues with dependencies
Decided to look elsewhere for something adjacent

Nextjs - as recommended on the react website this is a framework on top and it's out the box experience has no package vulnerabilities so opted for this instead

Typescript - 
personal preference, prefer the predictability that types provide

Prettier - opinionated formatter that suits my needs and just applies some consistency
