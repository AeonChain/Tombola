20:17 - finally got some time to get back to this, first port of call is make the Bean model match casing for c# (camel casing).

20:41 - bit of a pain getting the casing right but feel like it's important, going to get the frontend to populate the data using the back end now

20:54 - Merged the solution 2 branch down

21:04 - had some strange git behaviour from the obsidian config files, should have sorted it out earlier. Removed them from source control
