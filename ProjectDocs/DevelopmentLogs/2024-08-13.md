19:31 - little bit later today, going to try and get the order form going. Going to just add an "add to basket" feature if any items are in the basket at the order page i'll ask for details, send that to the backend to be stored.

19:44 - global state seems awkward, revaluating the plan, thinking of just getting an order form in place, going to just have a drop down to select which beans they want adding to an order with a name address line 1, address line 2, postcode, email and phone number. thinking of react hook forms to manage form state, makes for easy validation

20:15 - implemented the react form hooks and added yup to validate data easily

21:27 - rough styling of the form, creating api endpoint to shuttle the data to solution 2

21:52 - order form now sends to solution 2 need to create a success and error page and save the order down to the db
