18:11 early start today, hopefully get this finished off. Going to start with the bean of the day

19:59 - having major problems just loading the all, frontend returns an empty array, sending a get request to the api works fine.

20:00 - As i wrote the above, deleted .next build folder, working now, must have been some strange caching? that was bizzare

20:35 - good progress now i figured that out, got the BOTD logic wrote and a component designed for it.
